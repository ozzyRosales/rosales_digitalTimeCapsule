       <h1>Oscar Rosales</h1>
    
            <p>I am an aspiring product designer who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, 
                people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong technical skills and 
                an academic background in industrial design, product development, and marketing. My passion lies in solving 
                human-centric problems with design being at the center of all solutions. My objective is to collaborate and innovate 
                within different industries and have my work outlive me. In my undergrad studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles,
                including mentoring my community, various product developments, and client consulting work.
                I'm graduating in Spring 2024 and I'm interested in full-time product design or user interaction roles.
                
                I enjoy being out and about with my girlfriend, whether it's exploring new 
            restaurants and cuisines, immersing myself in the thrills of amusement parks, 
            or simply soaking up the energy of different environments. My adventurous spirit 
            seeks out excitement and new experiences wherever I go. At home, I share my 
            space with beloved companions—a golden retriever named Rex, a maltipoo named Shiloh, and a hamster named Pablo, 
            reflecting my caring and nurturing nature. My pets bring joy and companionship into 
            my life, adding another dimension to my daily experiences. </p>
